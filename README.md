# MITOS Repository

Welcome to the mitOS repository, a comprehensive resource for MIT's 2020 Operating Systems course. This repository houses my meticulously crafted solutions and detailed notes, designed to deepen understanding of operating systems concepts. All solutions are original, thoroughly tested, and aligned with the original MIT 2020 course structure.

## 📚 Repository Overview
This repository is divided into two primary components:

### Notes Branch:

A centralized collection of my detailed notes.
Includes in-depth interpretations of technical manuals and key insights from course lectures.
Serves as a valuable resource for understanding complex operating systems concepts.


### Solution Branches:

Structured to mirror the original MIT 2020 repository's branch organization.
Contains my original, verified solutions to assignments and labs, all of which have passed rigorous testing.
Each branch corresponds to a specific assignment or lab from the course.
